# BeautyHub - Web application for managing beauty salons based on React and .NET
The beauty salon management app enables salons to effectively present their services and employees to app visitors by providing a quick and easy view, but also search and sorting capabilities. 
This makes it easier to inform the user about the available offers. Registered users are enabled to quickly schedule appointments for the desired services, as well as to obtain a certain amount 
of money for a discount after each used service or possible cancellation of the appointment by the employee. One of the specifics is the possibility of selecting the so-called. a more convenient term. 
More convenient terms are terms that are busy that would suit the given user. He can mark them when scheduling, and the salon will inform him of the possible release of that term through a notification. 
The user also receives a notification in case his/her appointment is cancelled by the employee.
The application also provides a better insight into customer satisfaction through the employee rating system, as well as the salon itself. 
Users can leave comments about employees with whom they have performed one of the services or write recommendations about the salon. 
This allows salons to continuously improve the quality of their services.
A detailed overview of the business and individual contributions of employees is available to the salon manager, making it easier to make strategic decisions. 
He is also responsible for adding and removing employees from the database.
Employees in the salon are provided with a quick and easy overview of their working calendar of activities.
Every employee is obliged to confirm that term as completed after the service is completed. The date cannot be confirmed before it is completed in real time. 
By confirming the term by the employee, the user receives his discount amount depending on the price of the service.
Also, there is an administrator part of the application that allows you to manage the entire system, change information about the salon, delete inappropriate reviews about workers,
as well as add, delete and update service prices.
The system has a simple and intuitive interface adapted to all types of users. It has been tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. 
Users of this application will be persons who have personal computers and internet access, as well as employees for whom access to the application is provided at the workplace.
